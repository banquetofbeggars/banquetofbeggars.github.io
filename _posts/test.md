This is a link to the main webpage as a markdown link [asdf](index.md). It appears to need to be referenced without a leading slash to not point directly to the raw file.

This is just a link to the root page [asdf](/).

Most recent posts on [websockets](_posts/websockets_for_live_analytics.md).

Links can be to markdown pages, or their name when turned into an html page, or can be to completely separate html pages so long as they are included in the jekyll build.
If wanting to include extra javascript or html, it is probably worth embedding it into the markdown page to keep the theme consistent across the website.

And here is another to another .md file [here](test_two.md) It does not reference the nesting in _posts. Probably due to the 'include' statement?
